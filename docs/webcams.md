title: Using a camera
---

It is natural that viewers want to put a face to a voice. It helps with communication and therefore understanding if students can see your facial expressions. That being said, the course material is the focus of the lecture. Hence, if things are set up well students will naturally only look at the webcam footage when they need to.

### Camera position

- Place the camera slightly off to one side of your face.
- Position yourself such that your eyes are roughly 1/3 from the top and 1/3 from the side of the image.

    <p style="text-align: justify"> This gives the impression you are looking at whatever is in the center of the video. Viewers will naturally follow your eye line. You can move your eyes around your screen while you make the video, without this being obvious and distracting to the viewer. </p>

##### What’s behind you ?

Most people prefer a real background over a badly done green screen.   
But don't worry about it ! 

No one has the perfectly staged bookcase + plants + wooden floor + window + pet, not even stock images! 
People are curious … well nosy. So just check you are happy with it.
