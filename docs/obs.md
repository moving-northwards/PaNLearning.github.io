## Use OBS to record yourself presenting 

We recommend Open Broadcasting Software (OBS) as a great way to record yourself giving a presentation or lecture.
It has more flexibility and results in a higher quality video than simply recording your screen on zoom/skype.
It is easy to install and much easier to use than any video editing software.
