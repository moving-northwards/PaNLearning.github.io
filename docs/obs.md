## Use OBS to record yourself presenting 

We recommend Open Broadcasting Software (OBS) as a great way to record yourself giving a presentation or lecture.
It has more flexibility and results in a higher quality video than simply recording your screen on zoom/skype.
It is easy to install and much easier to use than any video editing software.

### Live Annotations

If you want to annotate your slides or have a 'blackboard', you can use a writing tablet. 

1. Connect your tablet to your laptop/computer. 
2. Open your preferred note taking app (e.g. OneNote). 
3. Use a window grab to include it in your OBS recording. 

**Mac**: If you want to use your ipad screen watch the next couple of minutes of the following tutorial:
