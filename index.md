## Creating a course

### First check you have an account
To become a teacher you first need to have an account on the e-learning platform. Request one [here](https://sim.e-neutrons.esss.dk/signup).

If you have forgotten your log in details please search for your account [here](https://pan-learning.org/moodle/login/forgot_password.php) to receive an automatic password reset email.

{% include note.html content="We are currently experiencing issues with UmbrellaID, hence you can only log on using account credentials specific to the e-learning platform." %}


### Contact us
If you would like to create a course please email [admin@pan-learning.org](mailto:admin@pan-learning.org). We will create you an empty course and assign you as teacher.

The course will only be accessible to yourself and administrators while you work on it. Only once you are ready will the course be made visible to students. 

### Creating multiple courses

If you think you will create many courses on the platform and want the flexibility of creating the empty courses yourself, we can give you course creator priveleges. To see how to create courses with course creator priveleges click here.
